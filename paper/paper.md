## 1. Abstract

Existing convolutional aproaches to audio generation often are limited to producing low-fidelity, single-channel, monophonic audio, while demanding significant computational resources for both training and inference. To address these challenges, this work introduces StereoSampleGAN, a novel audio generation architecture that combines a Deep Convolutional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), attention mechanisms, and loss optimization techniques. StereoSampleGAN allows high-fidelity, stereo audio generation for audio samples while being remaining computationally efficient. Training on three distinct sample datasets with varying spectral overlap–two of kick drums and one of tonal one shots–StereoSampleGAN demonstrates promising results in generating high quality simple stereo sounds. However, the model displays notable limitations when generating audio structures with greater amounts of spectral variation, indicating areas for further improvement.
