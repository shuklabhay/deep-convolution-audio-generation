## Abstract

## Introduction

[what are kick drums]

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have changed the landscape of the machine learning community, reaching new bounds in image generation [cite] and more recently natural language and audio generation [cite]. These audio generative models often employ Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) to create spectrogram representations of audio.

This work aims specifically to generate kick drums using a similar DCGAN approach.

Investigation tries to determine if dcgans can learn to recognize and replicate the spatial patterns and nonspatial distributions of a kick drum.

- TRY USING WASSERSTEIN LOSS SEE IF THERES ANY IMPROVEMENT IF THERE IS THEN HELL YEAH NEW NOVEL KICK DRUM GEN YAY!
- see if theres anything else i know that can be improved/possible source of error (prob not, but there has to be something it should be better w/ changes i made not "worse" its back to noise)
- at most spend today doing this but thats it. paper has to happen now.
