also talk abt like wavenet as other ideas for models

i have to be doing something wrong. it has to be doable. quickly just check it all make sure theres noooothing more i can do bc im sure its possible just limitations here idk what else i can do to improve model or wtv. there has to be some way to improve at least get better, allthe changes i made should be making it better bruh.

- go thru code and like clean up vars/make naming consistent (moreso helpers)
- see if theres anything else i know that can be improved/possible source of error (prob not, but there has to be something it should be better w/ changes i made not "worse" its back to noise)
- at most spend today doing this but thats it. paper has to happen now.
